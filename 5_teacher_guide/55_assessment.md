## Assessment of Learning from Digital Games

The way in which any game is assessed is crucial if it is to be purposeful, to be seen as appropriate by the students and to encourage them to engage in the learning experience.
There are seven aspects that should be examined when determining the effectiveness of game-based learning.

- **Learner performance** - whether learning has taken place and there is an improvement in learner performance. 
- **Motivation** â€“ the levels of student motivation, interest and participation in the game.
- **Perceptions** - the views of the students towards areas such as the experience of time passing, the realism of the game, amounts of complexity, support received and levels of perceived proficiency within the game.
- **Attitudes** - feelings of the learners and teachers towards the subject itself and the use of games for learning within that subject.
- **Collaboration** - the regularity and effectiveness of collaboration. (Connolly et al. argue that this is optional and dependent on the game design; I would argue that in the context of adult learning with games collaboration is an important part of the learning design.)
- **Preferences** - inclinations of the learners and teachers towards, for example, different learning styles or modes of interaction.
- Game-Based Learning **Environment** - factors associated with the game itself, such as the design of the environment, use of scaffolding, usability, levels of social presence and the way in which the game is deployed.
