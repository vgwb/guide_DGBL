## Approach
The approach to Digital Game-Based Learning needs to be well planned and organized to engage in learning and to produce the appropriate outcomes.

The coaches must learn to set the stage, providing relevant game information and support the students in their attempts to construct, deconstruct and reconstruct relevant forms of knowledge (both in relation to the game context, curricular goals and real life phenomena).

They must become familiar with the theoretical underpinnings of DGBL, learn about the specific games they will be using: techniques, gameplay, curriculum, outcomes, assistance, evaluation. For all that, we’ll provide a list of digital learning games as case studies for the coaches.

It is important to know the theory and the tools because games do not work by themselves and not all refugees/adults/coaches are comfortable with digital games.

## A Digital Game Based Learning session
We can summarise a DGBL session in these five steps:

### 1. Introduction to videogame
The teacher explains the game and helps installing it on the students devices.
Then tells the outcomes expected from playing this game.

### 2. gameplay / experience
autonomous activity: the student becomes player

### 3. game results / scores
autonomous activity: the player finish to play. check the score

### 4. reflection / analysis
student and the teacher analyse together the outcome

### 5. forming abstract concepts + real world application


## Teacher Skills
The teacher has to develop or at least know something about these topics:

- ICT / Basic Digital Skills
- Minimal game playing experience
- Deep understanding of how a game can help learning and its differences with a  classic book/course
- Recognise different players skills and support their game play
- Engage students in playing and progression

## Challenges
There could be some difficulties and challenges to be solved in order to achieve better results in DGBL sessions.

**Curriculum**: it’s hard to find games that fit the current curriculum or to identify how a certain game can connect to the curriculum.
Check out [commonsense.org/education](https://www.commonsense.org/education) for ideas. Remember that the best way to use games is as a supplemental reinforcement for your traditional teaching. Don’t look for games that will teach your curriculum. Instead, look for games that might approach the same subject area from a different perspective.

**Game related**: identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the content of the game. Irrelevant or distracting content from the game that could not be removed.

**Attitudes**: persuading all stakeholders and non-players about the educational value of the game.

**Educators and Teachers support**: make them aware of how to use games more effectively in education.

**Technology** many teacher are unfamiliar with technology. That’s okay. Most of the writing about game-based learning focuses on digital media, but the truth is that you don’t necessarily need devices. At the Quest To Learn school in New York City, game design is a way of thinking, a paradigm. A great deal of their curriculum uses paper-based games rather than digital games. 

**Assessment**: Traditional assessments do not often align with GBL, so new models and approaches must be considered.

**Developers** encourage and support game developers in the creation of better educational games

### Moderation
The impact of video games on society has been the subject of numerous studies. For example a psychologist at the Internet Institute at Oxford University, published a study establishing how much time should children be allowed to devote to video gaming. He reports that those who played less than an hour were more emotionally stable, while those who played for around three hours a day developed social problems. Therefore, when it comes to video games, **moderation is key**.
