# 4. Case Studies

## Learning Objectives
- types and categories of EVG
- know most famous VG and their educational values

## 4.1 Where to find EVG
When choosing an EVG we have several options where to look.
We could:

- Use entertainment/**commercial games**. These games are already in the stores and could have additional or not explicit educational content (Assassin's Creed / Civilization)
- **Modify** entertainment games. Many commercial games allow to create custom missions or quests (Kerbal Space Academy)
- Use **virtual worlds**. There are many "sandbox" games where the player sparks creativity and teacher could pre-build the learning environment (Minecraft)
- Use **educational games** created ad hoc (MinecraftEdu)
- **Create original games**. If a special requirements is needed, you could develop or ask to develop a custom game (Antura)
- **Let students create games**, to design a game you have to study and manage the learning content very deeply

http://playspent.org/

**Evoke**
Created by the World Bank Institute in conjunction with McGonigal, this game is a 10-week crash course in social innovation, giving players challenges from “food security” to “urban resilience,” and encouraging them to become a think tank on local challenges.

## 4.6 Genres and Commercial games
Many researchers have tried to categorize computer games into types or taxonomies, and although there are often large differences between them, there is also much similarity in terms of the general classifications. Here is a try to group them in general categories.

For the selected games we try to extract the **curricular connections** (learning topics) and the **possible skills taught**.

### Adventure
Adventure games are one of the oldest forms of computer game, going back to the early text adventures and interactive fiction of the 1970s and 1980s. They involve the player undertaking series of tasks or puzzles in which they must interact with the virtual world, performing actions, talking to characters and manipulating objects in order to achieve the objectives of the game, often to solve some mystery or complete a quest.

Although the original adventure games were text-based, contemporary commercial adventure games tend use graphics, offering three-dimensional worlds that players can navigate. There is also a growing popularity of simpler web-based adventures, known as point-and-click games, which typically provide two-dimensional environments in which the player has to navigate through rooms and make objects interact to solve the puzzles presented

Adventure games generally depend on **mental agility** rather than physical dexterity and tend **not to be time-dependent**. Some adventures combine elements of both and it is common for adventure games to contain mini-games in another genre. In terms of education, adventure games can **present a context for problem-solving and lateral thinking**, where players have to work out the appropriate actions in order to achieve a goal.

#### Gone home
![](img/games/gonehome.webp)

A first-person exploration game where the player plays as Kaitlin Greenbriar, a student returning from a trip abroad. Most disconcerting is the whereabouts of Kaitlin’s younger sister Sam who has vanished, though not without a trace. To help determine what happened to Sam, the player must follow clues and journal entries to uncover numerous secrets hidden throughout the house.

**Curricular connections:** English language arts; narrative studies; social and emotional learning; media literacy  
**Possible skills taught:** Environmental storytelling; character development; genre; linear vs. nonlinear narrative; game mechanics and narrative; intertextuality; perspective-taking

#### The walking dead
![](img/games/thewalkingdead.webp)

The Walking Dead tells the story Lee Everett, a teacher from Atlanta caught right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. During the game, the player plays as Lee through the trials and challenges that he and other survivors have to overcome. The gameplay is fairly straightforward, consisting mostly of controlling Lee to explore his surroundings and choosing his dialogue lines in conversation with other characters. As part of this, the player needs to act on Lee’s behalf in difficult, complex moral dilemmas.

**Curricular connections:** Moral philosophy; ethics; social norms, history of ideas  

**Possible skills taught:** Decision making; systems thinking; higher-order thinking skills, such as cause and effect; critical thinking; reflection; game-to-self connections; game-to-world connections; mindfulness

Tips:
1.  Teachers should play the episode they will be using at least twice, as deep knowledge of the game is crucial to make the necessary curricular connections.
2.  Teachers should encourage students to base their arguments on ethical theories, and not just their “gut feeling.”

#### Life is Strange
![](img/games/lifeisstrange.webp)

The player takes on role of the female character Max Caulfield, an eighteen-year-old photography student, who tries to save the people of the town from a catastrophic tornado that might befall the Bay. Playing the game through a third person perspective, the player controls the character Max’s movements to explore the game environments, to uncover the game stories through Max’s involvement in various events, and to make life-changing decisions for Max based on choices offered by the game’s branching narrative.

The player confronts several challenging moral dilemmas that require the player to make decisions, which ultimately could benefit one character but could cause devastating consequences for another.

In addition, the player can undo consequences by activating the rewinding clock game mechanic to travel to prior timepoints, and by making different decisions that can shape future events.

**Curricular connections:** Philosophy; ethics; logic; English language arts; social and emotional skills 
**Possible skills taught:** Philosophical analysis; ethical analysis; narrative design; logical thinking; analyzing moral dilemmas; narrative design

#### Assassin’s Creed (series)
![](img/games/assassin.webp)
The series comprises ten narrative-driven standard game chapters, each covering different chronological eras and locations, with a narrative arc that spans from Ptolemaic Egypt through the Holy Land at the time of the third Crusade; Renaissance Italy; the Americas in the Colonial Era; and the French Revolution. Gameplay is centered on open-world exploration, collecting hints and evidence and gathering or delivering information

**Curricular connections**: World history; World cultures; arts; English language learning; language learning; history of art and architecture; colonial history; piratical history; music
**Possible skills taught**: art and architecture appreciation; music appreciation; task-based problem solving; listening and reading comprehension (ESL, foreign languages); ethical decision-making; argumentation; empathy; analyzing moral dilemmas

#### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
![](img/games/zelda.webp)

This game drops the player in a vast, open-world landscape, giving Link complete freedom to explore the game’s many locations as he takes on a plethora of adventures, monsters, and puzzles. Because the game encourages experimentation and exploration, each player can shape the story according to their own pace and skills.

**Curricular connections:** Social and emotional skills; management  
**Possible skills taught**: Focus, organization, time management; working memory; executive function
**Tips:** 
1.  After the students play Breath of the Wild, teachers should ensure that they understand how the executive functioning skills were used in the game.
2.  One way teachers can support reflection on skills used in the game is by encouraging students to write down specific examples of when success completion of quests required the use of each skill.

### Platform
Platform games involve the movement of the player character through a landscape (usually two-dimensional), jumping up and down between platforms, avoiding obstacles and enemies, and picking up treasure, usually with some overall goal in mind and often in the context of a narrative. Platform games require physical dexterity and the aim is usually to score points and complete levels.
The types of skills that they develop are **hand–eye coordination**, **planning** and **strategizing, problem-solving** (the sequence of steps required to get over a particular obstacle for instance) and the ability to think quickly.

#### Braid
![](img/games/braid.webp)

#### Never Alone
![](img/games/neveralone.webp)

In Never Alone you play as a young Inupiat girl, Nuna, who goes off on a journey to discover the source of an eternal blizzard that is threatening to destroy her village. Along the way she encounters an Arctic fox and a series of spirit creatures who aid her in her journey. Never Alone is a puzzle platformer in which the player can either control both Nuna and her artic fox companion to solve a series of puzzles that require an understanding of how various Inupiat tools, environmental elements (e.g., wild animals and weather) and NPCs (usually in the form of Inupiat spirit creatures) work. 

**Curricular connections:** Social studies; social and emotional learning  
**Possible skills taught:** Systems thinking; collaboration; decision-making


#### Super Mario Maker 2
![](img/games/supermariomaker.webp)

### Puzzle
Puzzle games primarily involve problem-solving, can take many forms – including words, logic, mathematics – and are often based on traditional puzzles (for example online crosswords or spot-the-difference). Simple puzzle games can be stand-alone but they are also often embedded within a larger narrative structure so that solving the puzzles will complete some larger quest or story. It is common for puzzles to be embedded within other genres such as adventure games as mini-games. Puzzles can be used to support a variety of **different types of learning** depending on the type of puzzle, including **logic**, **spatial awareness**, **verbal skills**, **numeracy skills**, and **spelling**. I would also include quizzes in this category, and they are an example of a game activity that can be used in almost any area of a curriculum, but primarily for recall of facts.

#### Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
![](img/games/keeptalking.webp)
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative puzzle virtual reality (VR) game, where players must defuse a bomb in a specific number of minutes. The game places players in one of two roles, the VR player and the manual expert(s). The VR player wears a virtual reality headset while the manual experts access a separate resource called the bomb manual. Once the game starts, it transports the VR player into a window-less, police examination-style room with the bomb and some tools. Each bomb consists of a timer and a variety of modules containing complex symbols or sets of rules. The VR player can view, manipulate, rotate, and move the bomb and other objects in the room. In contrast, the manual expert cannot see the bomb but can peruse the bomb manual.

**Curricular connections**: Computer science; communication; English language arts; reading

Portal 2 (Valve Corporation, 2011) is a sequel to the original Portal both of which are enormously popular first-person puzzle-platform games where the player moves around the environment by shooting starting and ending portals into otherwise disconnected surfaces, thereby creating a link through which the player may move objects, including themselves. The game requires **extensive spatial acuity** and was quickly recognized for its potential use for **learning physics, problem solving, and critical thinking**.

**Curricular connections:** Physics, geometry, English language arts; social and emotional learning

**Possible skills taught:** Communication skills; teamwork; problem-solving; critical thinking; logical thinking; spatial analysis; employment/career skills

### Role Play
Role play games emerged from the face-to-face role-playing games and involve the player taking on the role of a character in another (usually fantasy-based) world.
The player can undertake a range of activities including solving quests, fighting, treasure hunting, and interacting with other characters (either other players in the game world or non-player characters). There is usually a mix of problem-solving skills required as well as strategy and sometimes physical dexterity, and although single-player role-playing games exist, they are commonly multi-player. Role play games are usually underpinned by complex statistical models that provide scores for a range of characteristics that determine a character’s abilities and weaknesses.
In the context of learning, role-playing games are good for providing a context for building **collaborative skills**, **social interaction**, **negotiation**, **management of complex systems** (e.g. character statistics), **strategy**, and working through scenarios.

#### Final Fantasy serie
![](img/games/finalfantasy.webp)

#### World of Warcraft
![](img/games/wow.webp)
World of Warcraft (WoW) is one of the first and largest subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) today. WoW offers players two factions (Alliance and Horde) who compete and collaborate to protect their world, Azeroth, against external and internal threats. Players can participate in a mix of activities such as **individual** and **collaborative** quests, gathering and crafting professions, raiding, battlegrounds, arenas, social and private text chat, and a combined open bid auction house. Players can also choose between individual gameplay, joining groups of up to 40 players, or joining guilds with 100s of members.

**Curricular connections:** Accounting; business; supply chain management  
**Possible skills taught:** Market research; financial statements; marketing; accounting spreadsheets; trading

#### Deus EX - Human Revolution

**Curricular connections:** Modern literature; science fiction; cultural studies; media studies, humanities; psychology; urban studies  
**Possible skills taught:** critical thinking, creativity, ethical judgment

### Shooter
Shooter games have the primary aim of using weapons (or sometimes spells and other special abilities) to defeat opponents, although the action is often embedded within a wider narrative context. They are generally played from a **first person** viewpoint (FPS First Person Shooter) and are played in real time. This is another genre in which **multi-player** games are common. Shooter games involve a combination of strategy and dexterity, exploring virtual worlds and defeating enemies and targets.
Although this is one genre in which it may be argued that there is less applicability to learning in higher education, there are still many skills that can be acquired by playing such games including forward **planning**, **strategizing**, and **team working**.

#### DOOM
![](img/games/doom.webp)

#### Call of Duty
![](img/games/callofduty.webp)
In the **single-player** campaign, the player takes on the roles of various characters, including a United States Marine and a British Special Air Service (SAS) operative. The player’s perspective changes dependent on the character and as the plot evolves through non-playable events and playable missions. Missions typically include objectives based around eliminating enemies, passing checkpoints, securing objectives against attackers or destroying an enemy location. In the **multiplayer** version, the series utilizes these mechanics for various team-based and deathmatch-based modes across various maps.

**Curricular connections:** History; politics; international relations; ethics   
**Possible skills taught:** Ethical decision-making; ethical design; analyzing moral dilemmas, narrative design

#### Fortnite
![](img/games/fortnite.webp)
Fortnite is an online action game published by Epic Games in 2017. It is set in a near future and adopts a third person perspective and cartoonish aesthetics. It includes three different modalities.

**Curricular connections:** Critical theory; digital cultures; educational technology; social and emotional learning  
**Possible skills taught:** Collaborative thinking; connectivist thinking; creativity; critical thinking; social media literacy

### Sports
Sports games allow the player to simulate taking part in a sporting event or tournament. They are generally based on physical dexterity and interaction with the gaming interface, but in recent years innovations such as dance mats and consoles that use movement-sensitive devices (the most notable example being the Nintendo consoles) have enabled players to actually undertake physical activity while playing.
Sporting games can be used to **practice** the actual skills of a sport (although in the majority of cases this will be a representation through whatever interaction device is available), **tactics**, **rules** and the ability to **think and make decisions quickly**.

#### NBA2K14
![](img/games/nba.webp)
**Curricular connections:** Social Studies; biomechanics; economics; biometrics; management **Possible skills taught:** Systems thinking; collaboration; decision-making; critical gaming vocabulary; critical thinking; historical awareness

### Strategy
Strategy games involve the player making strategic decisions within a scenario in order to meet the goal of the game, which is usually completing a level or solving a particular problem. They can involve, for example, movements of armies, progression of a group through various stages of development, management of resources or creation of environments to achieve specific purposes. For example, the strategy game Age of Empires involves players progressing their empire through stages of civilization. Many strategy games also have elements of **simulation** built into them in terms of a complex underlying model of a virtual environment, but will tend to have clear goals.
Strategy games can be used for teaching **planning**, **decision-making**, **testing hypotheses**, **strategic thinking**, **management skills** and **seeing the consequences** of actions taken.

#### Civilization 
![](img/games/civilization.webp)
Players guide a civilization from the bronze age to the near-future competing against other humans or an artificially intelligent computer player, earning points for how powerful and advanced their civilization becomes. Before starting a game, players choose one of multiple civilizations to lead, each with unique gameplay abilities based on the circumstances or achievements of their real-life counterparts.

**Curricular connections:** History; geography; civics; economics; sociology  
**Possible skills taught:** critical thinking; experimentation; cost-benefit analysis; cooperation; inquiry- based learning

**Tips:**
1. Teachers should take time to learn the structure, controls, and mechanics of the game before introducing students to it.
2. Students might have some initial frustration when learning how to play.
3. Teachers can explore specific topics by creating their own custom game or scenario.
Hundreds of free player-made mods can be found online.

#### Pandemic
![](img/games/pandemic.webp)
Pandemic is a cooperative game where a team of players take on unique roles (e.g., medic, scientist, researcher) as members of a global health organization who are charged with combating disease outbreaks and ultimately, curing four contagions as they emerge around the planet. Players are confronted with a collective choice as to how to best deploy their individual resources to confront immediate health conditions or develop a long-term plan to cure each illness.

**Curricular connections:** Public policy; epidemiology; health; biology; social and emotional learning; information sciences  

**Possible skills taught:** Algorithm building; probability-based predicting; argumentation; rhetoric; collaboration; communication; advocacy; planning; decision making; logic

#### SimCity
![](img/games/simcity.webp)

SimCity is a simulation video game with the main goal to develop a thriving city from small town beginnings. Players control the development of the city by defining development zones, installing technical infrastructure (e.g., traffic roads and water supply installments), and providing services (e.g., schools and fire departments). The type of development zones (industrial, commercial, or residential) determines the kinds of buildings that get automatically constructed in the zone. During the game, players must constantly ensure balanced development conditions, such as adherence to budgets and maintaining the satisfaction of citizens.

**Curricular connections**: urban and regional planning, urban development, urban geography, (governmental) policy making, technical infrastructure, environmental studies

**Possible skills taught:** systems thinking, system planning and control, system development, concept of sustainability

#### This War of Mine
![](img/games/thiswarofmine.webp)
Unlike a typical war game where players usually assume the role of capable soldiers, this game puts the player into the shoes of a group of civilians who live in a besieged city trying to survive, aiming to promote empathy and awareness of real-world armed conflicts, and many believed it was achieved

**Curricular connections:** Social and emotional learning; ethics; game design
**Possible skills taught:** Empathy; moral dilemmas; decision-making; narrative design
**Tips:**
1.  Game play can extend outside the classroom for a more complete experience.
2.  For a more advanced study, students can start the game with a weaker character profile—instead of the initial settings suggested in Figure 3—to challenge the player’s morality and decision-making skills.

### Casual games
Another type of game (which isn’t really a genre in itself as there are many different types) that is currently growing in popularity is casual games. These games are usually downloaded from gaming sites rather than being available in shops and are cheaper than traditional entertainment games (or free to play online).
Casual games are designed to be played in **short bursts** rather than for prolonged sessions so are **chunked into many small levels** that all follow the same pattern, so that they can be played for a few minutes at a time and easily stopped and restarted. These games cater for players who simply want to play a game for a short time and do not want to make any great commitment in terms of time or learning how to play. They have **simple game play** and comparatively low production values. The rise in the use of casual games shows a movement away from the typical ‘hardcore’ gamer to a wider demographic, particularly female and older players, which is more typical of the whole university student demographic, and casual games may be most appropriate for fitting into specific segments of teaching time.

#### Antura & the Letters
![](img/games/antura.webp)
The educational goal of the game is to help players to acquire the basics of Arabic literacy, including Arabic letters, reading comprehension, and some vocabulary. But the game also has a social well-being objective to support flow, engagement, and motivation

**Curricular connections**: Language learning; Arabic literacy; social and emotional learning (SEL)
**Possible skills taught**: Recognizing letters (shapes, names, phonemes); syllables and word reading; vocabulary

#### Fancade
![](img/games/fancade.webp)




### Sandbox
#### Minecraft
![](img/games/minecraft.webp)
Minecraft is an open-world game, allowing players opportunity for unlimited exploration and creation. Gameplay takes place in a pixelated 3-D environment resembling a natural world with many different biomes (e.g. forests, tundra, and deserts). Every element of the world is made from blocks of corresponding materials. For example, trees are made from blocks of wood and ores in blocks of ore. Players can break apart and collect these blocks using their hands, or tools crafted in the game using found materials. Survival is the key objective of Minecraft, which is predicated on players’ ability to maintain both their own health and wellbeing.

**Curricular connections:** Foundational knowledge (English language arts, geography); meta-knowledge (cause and effect, narrative experience); humanistic knowledge (cultural competence)  
**Possible skills taught:** Writing; critical thinking; exploration; experimentation; cause and effect; mapping; building; design; creativity; resource management; communication
