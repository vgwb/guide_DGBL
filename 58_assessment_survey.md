## 5.8 Engagement Survey
This questionnaire can be used after an activity has been completed to evaluate the level of engagement relative to another activity. In order to analyse the results and compare levels of engagement between two different activities the following steps should be taken.

- Allocate a value to each answer, where strongly disagree = -2 to strongly agree = 2
- For negative items (e.g. ‘I could not tell what effect my actions had’) reverse this scale.
- Add up the total points to get a value for engagement with the activity.

Thinking about the activity you have just undertaken, please indicate the level to which you agree with the following statements:

> Strongly Disagree (-2) | Disagree (-1) | Neither agree nor disagree (0) | Agree (1) | Strongly Agree (2)
