### Digital Game-Based Learning

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets. There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving ([Sandberg et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref59)). Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as English ([Yang and Chen, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref78)), Maths ([Hung et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref31); [Deng et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref18)), Sciences ([Chen, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref13)), and STEAM ([Chen and Huang, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref14)). The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve studentsâ€™ learning motivation ([Su, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref63); [Lin et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref45)), learning performance ([Lin et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref45)), reduce their cognitive load ([Su, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref63); [Chen and Huang, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref14)), and anxiety ([Su, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.750711/full#ref63)).
