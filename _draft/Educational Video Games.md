Geniventure is an educational video game that teaches students the basics of genetics and trait inheritance through challenging and engaging levels.

The Geniventure game informs students on the basics of genetics through a narrative about dragons and their model species (the drake). A war has broken out between kingdoms, endangering the dragon population. The player’s goal is to learn to breed dragons to prevent their extinction and help win the war. A diverse cast of characters in a scientific Guild appears on screen to present challenges that gradually increase in difficulty as the player’s genetic understanding grows. This form of game-based pedagogy allows students to develop skills and competencies such as

-   Collaboration
-   Creative problem-solving
-   Communication
-   Cognitive skills

Moreover, it engages learners to a degree that their knowledge acquisition of the topic and retention is much higher as they are able to interact with the subject through characters and can only pass challenges if they fully understand the underlying concepts of genetics and inheritance

This is a FREE online service that allows teachers to incorporate it in their curriculum to enhance instruction and comprehension of complex science topics.
