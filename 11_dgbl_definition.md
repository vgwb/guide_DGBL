## 1.1 Definition

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets.
There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving. Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve studentsâ€™ learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.

## 1.2 Engagement

Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak. When students arenâ€™t engaged, theyâ€™re more likely to disrupt class, less likely to accept challenges, have lower grades, and arenâ€™t confident in their ability to learn.

Additionally, **sustaining engagement** is very important to ensure that the student is gaining the most out of their learning experience and that their **cognitive skills are always stimulated**. Engaging through educational video games that are built on educational content has proven to be a great way not only to keep students engaged but also to **deliver complex theories/topics in an interactive manner** allowing students to have a **deeper comprehension of the content**.


## 1.3 What is game based learning?

The design of more engaging curriculum we need to include techniques that teaches students how to be **critical**, **confident** and **creative** as well as abilities that they will need for success in the **work-a-day future life**. Many schools have adopted game-based learning, a pedagogical approach that involves **designing learning activities through video games where the game characteristics and game principles inhere within the learning activities themselves**.

For example, in an Economics course, students might compete in a virtual stock-trading competition, in a science class, students learn about genetics through *Geniventure*, a dragon hereditary game. There are many forms of game-based learning, including introduction of badges, leaderboards, and educational video games. Our focus here is educational video games and how they can be utilised to enhance curriculum development and student content comprehension.

**Gaming is inherently motivating**, which may allow learners to gain skills and knowledge, by leveraging entertainment and weaving it within learning environments. Research studies indicate that video games in particular have great engagement and education related benefits.
