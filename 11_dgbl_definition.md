## 1.1 Definition

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets.
There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving. Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve studentsâ€™ learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.

## 1.2 Engagement

Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak. When students arenâ€™t engaged, theyâ€™re more likely to disrupt class, less likely to accept challenges, have lower grades, and arenâ€™t confident in their ability to learn.

Additionally, **sustaining engagement** is very important to ensure that the student is gaining the most out of their learning experience and that their **cognitive skills are always stimulated**. Engaging through educational video games that are built on educational content has proven to be a great way not only to keep students engaged but also to **deliver complex theories/topics in an interactive manner** allowing students to have a **deeper comprehension of the content**.

> Game-based learning and video games provide much more learning opportunities than expected.
