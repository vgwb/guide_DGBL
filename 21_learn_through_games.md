## 2.3 Games selection

After we have established the definition of game-based learning, its basis, and how its implementation enhances several social and cognitive skills, the question now diverts to **how we can select an educational video game that elicit engagement and motivation as well as ensure that it is designed with the intended educational content**.
There are many educational video games available for class implementation, however, many are redundant, easy or stimulatingly boring that students are just not as interested or motivated to play.
In this unit, we will discuss the characteristics of a good educational video game, its attributes, and how educators can ensure that they are providing their students with the best quality of learning through the selected video game.
