- What to assess?

## 6.1 Assessment of Learning from Digital Games

The way in which any game is assessed is crucial if it is to be purposeful, to be seen as appropriate by the students and to encourage them to engage in the learning experience.
There are seven aspects that should be examined when determining the effectiveness of game-based learning.

- **Learner performance** - whether learning has taken place and there is an improvement in learner performance. 
- **Motivation** – the levels of student motivation, interest and participation in the game.
- **Perceptions** - the views of the students towards areas such as the experience of time passing, the realism of the game, amounts of complexity, support received and levels of perceived proficiency within the game.
- **Attitudes** - feelings of the learners and teachers towards the subject itself and the use of games for learning within that subject.
- **Collaboration** - the regularity and effectiveness of collaboration. (Connolly et al. argue that this is optional and dependent on the game design; I would argue that in the context of adult learning with games collaboration is an important part of the learning design.)
- **Preferences** - inclinations of the learners and teachers towards, for example, different learning styles or modes of interaction.
- Game-Based Learning **Environment** - factors associated with the game itself, such as the design of the environment, use of scaffolding, usability, levels of social presence and the way in which the game is deployed.

## 6.2 Evaluation Tools: Analytics
The analysts part is the more important

## 6.3 Engagement Survey
This questionnaire can be used after an activity has been completed to evaluate the level of engagement relative to another activity. In order to analyse the results and compare levels of engagement between two different activities the following steps should be taken.

- Allocate a value to each answer, where strongly disagree = -2 to strongly agree = 2
- For negative items (e.g. ‘I could not tell what effect my actions had’) reverse this scale.
- Add up the total points to get a value for engagement with the activity.

Thinking about the activity you have just undertaken, please indicate the level to which you agree with the following statements:

> Strongly Disagree (-2) | Disagree (-1) | Neither agree nor disagree (0) | Agree (1) | Strongly Agree (2)

- I wanted to complete the activity
- I found the activity frustrating
- I felt that I could achieve the goal of the activity
- I knew what I had to do to complete the activity
- I found the activity boring
- It wasn’t clear what I could and couldn’t do
- It was clear what I could learn from the activity
- I felt absorbed in the activity 
- The activity was pointless
- I was not interested in exploring the options available
- I did not care how the activity ended
- I felt that time passed quickly
- I found the activity satisfying
- The activity would not let me do what I wanted
- I could not tell what effect my actions had
- I did not enjoy the activity
- Feedback I was given was useful
- I found it easy to get started
