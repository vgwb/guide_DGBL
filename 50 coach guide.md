## A Digital Game Based Learning session
We can summarize a DGBL session in these five steps:

### 1. Introduction to videogame
The coach explains the game and helps installing it on the students devices.
Then tells the outcomes expected from playing this game.


- gameplay / experience (autonomous)
- game results / scores (autonomous)
- reflection / analysis (+coach)
- forming abstract concepts + real world application

> exercise: order the 5 steps

# Coach Skills
- ICT / Basic Digital Skills
- Minimal game playing experience
- Deep understanding of how a game can help learning and its differences with a  classic book/course
- Recognise different players skills and support their game play
- Engage students in playing and progression

# GBL challenges
**Curriculum**: identify how a certain game can connect to the curriculum. 

**Game related**: identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the content of the game. Irrelevant or distracting content from the game that could not be removed.

**Attitudes**: persuading all stakeholders and non-players about the educational value of the game.

**Educators and Teachers support**: make them aware of how to use games more effectively in education.

**Assessment**: Traditional assessments do not often align with GBL, so new models and approaches must be considered.

**Developers** encourage and support game developers in the creation of better educational games


# Assessment of Learning from Digital Games

The way in which any game is assessed is crucial if it is to be purposeful, to be seen as appropriate by the students and to encourage them to engage in the learning experience.
There are seven aspects that should be examined when determining the effectiveness of game-based learning.

- **Learner performance** - whether learning has taken place and there is an improvement in learner performance. 
- **Motivation** – the levels of student motivation, interest and participation in the game.
- **Perceptions** - the views of the students towards areas such as the experience of time passing, the realism of the game, amounts of complexity, support received and levels of perceived proficiency within the game.
- **Attitudes** - feelings of the learners and teachers towards the subject itself and the use of games for learning within that subject.
- **Collaboration** - the regularity and effectiveness of collaboration. (Connolly et al. argue that this is optional and dependent on the game design; I would argue that in the context of adult learning with games collaboration is an important part of the learning design.)
- **Preferences** - inclinations of the learners and teachers towards, for example, different learning styles or modes of interaction.
- Game-Based Learning **Environment** - factors associated with the game itself, such as the design of the environment, use of scaffolding, usability, levels of social presence and the way in which the game is deployed.

## 5.2 Students pre-evaluation and setup 

### Hardware and Digital Skills evaluation
We want to know how much the user knows about digital world, hardware, smartphone
[Survey Informatics](1000%20quiz_digital.md)

### VG Evaluation
We want to know if user knows a bit about videogames
[Survey Videogames](1000%20quiz_videogames.md)

### Setup device
Install the game on the device and run it once.
If needed do some Android tuning (notifications, for example)

## 5.3 Team and individual facilitation 

Explain the IEEDO app, how it works, what they have to do.

## 5.4 Evaluation tools

### Engagement Survey:
0.This questionnaire can be used after an activity has been completed to evaluate the level of engagement relative to another activity. In order to analyse the results and compare levels of engagement between two different activities the following steps should be taken.
-   Allocate a value to each answer, where strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 5 (as this is a relative scale rather than an absolute value you could equally well allocate values from strongly disagree = -2 to strongly agree = 2).
- For negative items (e.g. ‘I could not tell what effect my actions had’) reverse this scale.
- Add up the total points to get a value for engagement with the activity.


Thinking about the activity you have just undertaken, please indicate the level to which you agree with the following statements:

Strongly Disagree - Disagree - Neither agree nor disagree - Agree - Strongly Agree

- I wanted to complete the activity
- I found the activity frustrating
- I felt that I could achieve the goal of the activity
- I knew what I had to do to complete the activity
- I found the activity boring
- It wasn’t clear what I could and couldn’t do
- It was clear what I could learn from the activity
- I felt absorbed in the activity 
- The activity was pointless
- I was not interested in exploring the options available
- I did not care how the activity ended
- I felt that time passed quickly
- I found the activity satisfying
- The activity would not let me do what I wanted
- I could not tell what effect my actions had
- I did not enjoy the activity
- Feedback I was given was useful
- I found it easy to get started
