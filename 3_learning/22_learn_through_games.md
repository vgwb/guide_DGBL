- **Motivational** - encourages an incremental approach
- **Cognitive** -improves attention, focus, and reaction time
- **Social** - translates the social skills learned into relations outside the gaming environment
- **Emotional** - encourages positive mood states and adaptive emotion regulation

## Games selection

After we have established the definition of game-based learning, its basis, and how its implementation enhances several social and cognitive skills, the question now diverts to **how we can select an educational video game that elicit engagement and motivation as well as ensure that it is designed with the intended educational content**.
There are many educational video games available for class implementation, however, many are redundant, easy or stimulatingly boring that students are just not as interested or motivated to play.
In this unit, we will discuss the characteristics of a good educational video game, its attributes, and how educators can ensure that they are providing their students with the best quality of learning through the selected video game.

# Where to find EVG
When choosing an EVG we have several options where to look. We could:

- Use entertainment/**commercial games**. These games are already in the stores and could have additional or not explicit educational content (Assassin's Creed / Civilization)
- **Modify** entertainment games. Many commercial games allow to create custom missions or quests (Kerbal Space Academy)
- Use **virtual worlds**. There are many "sandbox" games where the player sparks creativity and teacher could pre-build the learning environment (Minecraft)
- Use **educational games** created ad hoc (MinecraftEdu)
- **Create original games**. If a special requirements is needed, you could develop or ask to develop a custom game (Antura)
- **Let students create games**, to design a game you have to study and manage the learning content very deeply
