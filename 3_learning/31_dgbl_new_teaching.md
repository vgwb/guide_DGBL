## Video Games and new teaching methods

Recent studies have shown that introducing educational video games (EVG) and adopting a game-based learning teaching approach, has helped students achieve better learning performance, improved student **engagement**, promote **motivation** and **active processing** of educational content.

Introducing video games into the classroom **enhances many learning and teaching skills** that can help elevate the educational experience of the classroom. This teaching method uses beneficial aspects of video games to transmit knowledge to students. It is based on **three key factors**:

1. It breathes life into education: it transforms learning into an **enjoyable**, thrilling game without boring lessons. Students assimilate and retain information almost without noticing.
2. It **boosts motivation**: students are the main characters in the story and their success is rewarded with medals, extra lives, bonuses, etc. This captures and keeps their interest in learning.
3. It gives **opportunities to practice** students can apply the knowledge they acquire without getting into dangerous situations. This is what flight and navigation simulators, for instance, are all about.


## How effective are video games in the classroom?

Let's see some Pros and Cons of video games

### PROS
- Improve Tech Literacy
- Develop Muti-tasking mentality
- Experience Teamwork
- Practice Long-range planning
- Provide Individualised instruction

### CONS
- Cost (higher than book-paper-pencil paradigm)
- Distraction from other objectives
- Social isolation
- Shortened attention span

## Learning Principles
Here are the 16 principles of good video-game based learning:

1. **Identity**: Players build a sense of identity throughout the video game, either through direct input or an on-screen character they inherit.
2. **Interaction**: Communication occurs between the player and the game.
3. **Production**: Gamers help produce the story through some form of interaction, such as choosing a path, solving a puzzle or completing a level.
4. **Risk Taking**: Failing in a game holds few consequences in comparison to real life, empowering players to take risks.
5. **Customized**: Games usually offer a level of customization so that users can play - and succeed - at their competency level.
6. **Agency**: Players have control over the gaming environment.
7. **Well-Ordered Problems**: The gaming environment contains problems that naturally lead into one another, allowing a player’s mastery to grow and evolve.
8. **Challenge and Consideration**: Games offer a problem that challenges students’ assumed expertise.
9. **Just in Time or On Demand**: Players receive information as they need it, not before, which teaches them patience and perseverance and improves critical-thinking abilities.
10. **Situated Meanings**: Students learn new vocabulary words by experiencing them within game situations.
11. **Pleasantly Frustrating**: The game should frustrate the student enough to challenge them but be easy enough that they believe and can overcome the problem(s) faced.
12. **System Thinking**: Games make players think in a bigger picture, not just individual actions taken, helping them see how the pieces fit or can be fitted together.
13. **Explore, Think Laterally, Rethink Goals**: Games force players to expand their situational knowledge and consider courses of action other than linear ones.
14. **Smart Tools and Distributed Knowledge**: In-game tools help students understand the world. Through using them, they gain confidence to share their knowledge with others.
15. **Cross-Functional Teams**: In multiplayer environments, players have different skills, forcing them to rely on each other - a needed soft skill for students.
16. **Performance before Competence**: Competency occurs through taking action in the game, reversing the typical model in which students are required to learn before being allowed to act.

These learning principles should be applied to school learning at all times, not just through educational video games. They change the current trend for skill-and-drill, scripted instruction, and standardized multiple-choice testing.
