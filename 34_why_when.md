## 3.4 When and why implement EVGs?
You must remember that game-based learning and EVGs are tools that should supplement/facilitate your pedagogy, they are not the teacher. When using these techniques in your classroom, **do not grade play**, **instead assess the learning transfer** that has been facilitated from the game experience to the curriculum.

Therefore, choosing to implement EVGs should come as a reason to enhance content delivery and comprehension as well as motivate students to understand complex theories/content in a mind engaging and challenging manner.
