## Unit review
Now that we have established what is game-based learning and why using educational video games is beneficial, please respond to the following questions:

- who can use DGBL? (students, everyone, teachers, kids)
- why is DGBL so powerful? (cheap, easy, engaging)
- is Engagement good for learners? (yes, no, we don't know yet)

- Create your own definition of game-based learning
- How do you believe educational video games would support your pedagogical approaches and enhance your teaching methods?
- How would you introduce educational video games in your classroom?
