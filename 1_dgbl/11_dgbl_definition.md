## DGBL Definition

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets.
There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving. Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve studentsâ€™ learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.

## Approach
The approach to Digital Game-Based Learning needs to be well planned and organized to engage in learning and to produce the appropriate outcomes.

The coaches must learn to set the stage, providing relevant game information and support the students in their attempts to construct, deconstruct and reconstruct relevant forms of knowledge (both in relation to the game context, curricular goals and real life phenomena).

They must become familiar with the theoretical underpinnings of DGBL, learn about the specific games they will be using: techniques, gameplay, curriculum, outcomes, assistance, evaluation. For all that, weâ€™ll provide a list of digital learning games as case studies for the coaches.

It is important to know the theory and the tools because games do not work by themselves and not all refugees/adults/coaches are comfortable with digital games.Â 

## Engagement

Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak. When students arenâ€™t engaged, theyâ€™re more likely to disrupt class, less likely to accept challenges, have lower grades, and arenâ€™t confident in their ability to learn.

Additionally, **sustaining engagement** is very important to ensure that the student is gaining the most out of their learning experience and that their **cognitive skills are always stimulated**. Engaging through educational video games that are built on educational content has proven to be a great way not only to keep students engaged but also to **deliver complex theories/topics in an interactive manner** allowing students to have a **deeper comprehension of the content**.

## What is game based learning?

The design of more engaging curriculum we need to include techniques that teaches students how to be **critical**, **confident** and **creative** as well as abilities that they will need for success in the **work-a-day future life**. Many schools have adopted game-based learning, a pedagogical approach that involves **designing learning activities through video games where the game characteristics and game principles inhere within the learning activities themselves**.

**Gaming is inherently motivating**, which may allow learners to gain skills and knowledge, by leveraging entertainment and weaving it within learning environments. Research studies indicate that video games in particular have great engagement and education related benefits.

# Motivation
Motivation is the force behind human performance. It can arise from physiological or psychological needs, thoughts, or emotions. Our physiological needs help us preserve optimal physical functioning, while psychological needs typically help us thrive.

The source of motivation can come from within ourselves or be external to us.

## Intrinsic Motivation

> **Intrinsic motivation** is when you are motivated by personal satisfaction or enjoyment instead of external factors like reward or punishment. There are ways to make tasks more intrinsically motivating.

Intrinsic motivation is the act of doing something without any obvious external rewards. You do it because itâ€™s enjoyable and interesting, rather than because of an outside incentive or pressure to do it, such as a reward or deadline.

An example of intrinsic motivation would be reading a book because you enjoy reading and have an interest in the story or subject, rather than reading because you have to write a report on it to pass a class.

### Intrinsic motivation theory

There have been a number of different proposed theories to explain intrinsic motivation and how it works. Some experts believe that all behavior is driven by external reward, such as money, status, or food. In intrinsically motivated behaviors, the reward is the activity itself.

The most recognized theory of intrinsic motivation was first based on peopleâ€™s needs and drives. Hunger, thirst, and sex are biological needs that weâ€™re driven to pursue in order to live and be healthy.

Just like these biological needs, people also have psychological needs that must be satisfied in order to develop and thrive. These include the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

Along with satisfying these underlying psychological needs, intrinsic motivation also involves seeking out and engaging in activities that we find challenging, interesting, and internally rewarding without the prospect of any external reward.

### Intrinsic motivation vs. extrinsic motivation

**Intrinsic motivation comes from within, while extrinsic motivation arises from outside**. When youâ€™re intrinsically motivated, you engage in an activity solely because you enjoy it and get personal satisfaction from it.

When youâ€™re extrinsically motivated, you do something in order to gain an external reward. This can mean getting something in return, such as money, or avoiding getting into trouble, such as losing your job.

|   | Motivation | Goals |
|---|---|---|
|Intrinsic|You do the activity because itâ€™s internally rewarding. You may do it because itâ€™s fun, enjoyable, and satisfying.|Goals come from within and the outcomes satisfy your basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.|
|Extrinsic|You do the activity in order to get an external reward in return.	Goals are focused on an outcome and donâ€™t satisfy your basic psychological needs.|Goals involve external gains, such as money, fame, power, or avoiding consequences.|

### Intrinsic motivation examples

Youâ€™ve likely experienced examples of intrinsic motivation throughout your entire life without giving it much thought.

Some examples of intrinsic motivation are:

- participating in a sport because itâ€™s fun and you enjoy it rather than doing it to win an award
- learning a new language because you like experiencing new things, not because your job requires it
- spending time with someone because you enjoy their company and not because they can further your social standing
- cleaning because you enjoy a tidy space rather than doing it to avoid making your spouse angry
- playing cards because you enjoy the challenge instead of playing to win money
- exercising because you enjoy physically challenging your body instead of doing it to lose weight or fit into an outfit
- volunteering because you feel content and fulfilled rather than needing it to meet a school or work requirement
- going for a run because you find it relaxing or are trying to beat a personal record, not to win a competition
- taking on more responsibility at work because you enjoy being challenged and feeling accomplished, rather than to get a raise or promotion
- painting a picture because you feel calm and happy when you paint rather than selling your art to make money

### Intrinsic motivation factors

Everyoneâ€™s different and that includes what motivates us and our perspectives of rewards. Some people are more intrinsically motivated by a task while another person sees the same activity extrinsically.

Both can be effective, but research suggests that extrinsic rewards should be used sparingly because of the overjustification effect. Extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation when used in certain situations or used too often. The rewards may lose their value when you reward behavior that was already intrinsically motivating. Some people also perceive extrinsic reinforcement as coercion or bribery.

The overjustification effect has inspired an entire field of study that focuses on students and how to help them reach their full potential. Though experts are divided on whether extrinsic rewards have a beneficial or negative effect on intrinsic motivation, a recent study showed that rewards may actually encourage intrinsic motivation when given early in a task.

Researchers examined how reward timing influenced intrinsic motivation. They found that giving an immediate bonus for working on a task, rather than waiting until the task was completed, increased interest and enjoyment in it. Getting an earlier bonus increased motivation and persistence in the activity that continued even after the award was removed.

Understanding the factors that promote intrinsic motivation can help you see how it works and why it can be beneficial. These factors include:

- **Curiosity**. Curiosity pushes us to explore and learn for the sole pleasure of learning and mastering.
- **Challenge**. Being challenged helps us work at a continuously optimal level work toward meaningful goals.
- **Control**. This comes from our basic desire to control what happens and make decisions that affect the outcome.
- **Recognition**. We have an innate need to be appreciated and satisfaction when our efforts are recognized and appreciated by others.
- **Cooperation**. Cooperating with others satisfies our need for belonging. We also feel personal satisfaction when we help others and work together to achieve a shared goal.
- **Competition**. Competition poses a challenge and increases the importance we place on doing well.
- **Fantasy**. Fantasy involves using mental or virtual images to stimulate your behavior. An example is a virtual game that requires you to answer a question or solve a problem to move to the next level. Some motivation apps use a similar approach.
