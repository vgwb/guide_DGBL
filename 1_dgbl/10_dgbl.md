## DGBL Definition

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets. There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as *fun*, play*,* *goals*, *competition*, and *problem-solving*. Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve students’ learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.

## What is Learning
Defining what constitutes _game-based learning_ in DGBL necessitates a recognition of the contested nature of _learning_ itself as a concept. Broadly speaking, there are two general metaphors that have been historically utilized by the educational research community to define and describe learning.
1. The first view characterizes _learning as acquisition_, be it the acquisition of knowledge, skills, dispositions, behaviors, or other outcomes deemed desirable by educators and institutions. This generally aligns with what scholars call a cognitive perspective on learning, which emphasizes internal mental processes such as memory, decision-making, thinking, and knowledge construction as fundamental to learning. It also speaks to behaviorist conceptions of learning, which tend to emphasize observable behaviors as indicators of learning.
2. The second metaphor characterizes _learning as participation_ and emphasizes processes of socialization, mentorship, participation, and social practice. Within the field of education, this metaphor generally informs scholarship identified with a sociocultural perspective on learning, which tends to highlight social practices, identities, and relationships as core to learning.

## What is a Game?
Turning to discussions of what constitutes “games” in relation to learning, it is first important to recognize that across a range of disciplines and perspectives, definitions have varied. Synthesizing a number of these perspectives on games, play, and culture, game designers Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman defined

> a game as a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome

A game is a **system** because it involves a set of things (rules, objects, players, etc.) that affect each other within an environment to form a larger pattern that is different from any of the individual parts.
A game also involves **players**-active participants interacting with the system of the game in order to experience the play of the game. Although people may not always associate games with **conflict**, but not all games need be a contest between players (e.g., solo games such as solitaire or cooperative games).
All games involve **rules** that provide the structure out of which gameplay emerges, by delimiting what a player can or cannot do.
Finally, this definition asserts that all games involve some kind of **quantifiable outcome** - in its simplest form, a state of victory or defeat. 

## Digital Versus Analog Games

Just as analog games can take on a variety of forms, so too can digital games appear on a multitude of computer-based electronic platforms. These include games installed as software on personal computers, as well as games played through television-attached gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox. Digital game platforms also include dedicated handheld platforms, such as the Nintendo Gameboy and its various incarnations, as well as mobile smartphones and tablet computers. These games can be engaged as a single player, with multiple players in a single physical location, or with players across distances using online connective features.

[Salen Tekinbaş and Zimmerman (2003)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0054) suggested there are at least four key traits that distinguish digital games from non-digital ones. Each trait has important implications for DGBL across a variety of contexts. The first is that digital games can offer experiences of interactivity that are generally characterized by both immediacy and focus. This is largely by virtue of the fact that digital games are programmed into computer consoles. Programming provides increased immediacy of feedback because the system is automated to respond to player input. Programming also provides a narrowed range of interactivity because possible player inputs and outcomes are limited by what a digital game developer has programmed into the software. Second, digital games and digital media more broadly make use of a computer’s affordances for collecting, storing, retrieving, manipulating, revealing, or even concealing information in the form of images, text, animations, sound, and even player behavioral data ([Murray, 1997](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0042), [2017](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0043)). Third, due to their computational nature, digital games have the potential to automate systems and procedures that may be far more complex for non-digital games to simulate. Examples of these complex systems include simulated environmental features in computer-based role-playing games: terrain–movement interactions, lines of sight, weather cycles, and even interactions with animals or non-player characters in the virtual game world ([Dunnigan, 2000](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0027)). Finally, many (although not all) contemporary digital games have the ability to facilitate communication between players across networks, such as the online networks that connect players in multiplayer, internet-connected games. These communication-facilitating features can include technologies that enable voice or text chat between players within a particular game.

## What is Game-Based Learning?

A critical appraisal of the _game-based_ aspect of DGBL can help better situate the usage of this concept in theory and practice. Building on [Sfard’s (1998)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0056) learning as an acquisition metaphor, one way to define game-based learning in DGBL is by the use of digital games to promote the acquisition of a variety of knowledge, skills, dispositions, or other educational outcomes. According to this definition, learning is game-based when digital games—or certain elements of digital games such as scorekeeping—are applied toward identifiable outcomes defined by educators or institutions. Examples of this can be seen in games that are explicitly designed for education, such as the _Reader Rabbit_ computer game series (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1983) for addressing aspects of reading and the more contemporary _DragonBox_ game series (WeWantToKnow, 2012) designed to teach about mathematical concepts and procedures. Further examples can be seen through research on COTS games, such as the _Civilization_ series, that are utilized in educational settings ([Squire, 2004](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0062); [Van Eck, 2015](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0068)).

Another framing of DGBL, drawing on [Sfard’s (1998)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0056) learning as participation metaphor, characterizes the _game-based_ aspect of DGBL as an inherent part of meaningfully participating in—that is, playing—games, regardless of their connection to some external educational outcome ([Koster, 2013](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0039)). According to this definition, learning is always happening when someone plays a game. Having to solve problems, overcome obstacles, or collaborate with others within and around games are all dimensions of learning. As game designer and theorist [Raph Koster (2013)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0039) noted in _A Theory of Fun_, a game is only “good” to the degree that it is “fun,” and a game is only fun to the degree which players are being challenged to learn to be successful in that game space. Scholars who adopt this perspective tend to examine game-based learning as it occurs within video game worlds, such as among player groups in the massively multiplayer role-playing game (MMORPG) _World of Warcraft_ (e.g., [Nardi, 2010](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0044)). In addition to examining commercial games, however, advocates of this approach have also designed games to address real-world challenges, such as facing the everyday challenges of a world in which oil is no longer in ready supply ([McGonigal, 2011](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0041)).

_Gamification_, often categorized as a subconcept of DGBL, describes the implementation of certain aspects of digital games—visual displays of progress, automated reward systems, scoring leaderboards, virtual avatars, and others—into non-gaming contexts such as education, business management, marketing, and even physical exercise programs ([Deterding et al., 2011](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0025)). Proponents of gamification often cite research demonstrating the positive impacts of these interventions on outcomes such as academic performance, student motivation, customer retention, organizational productivity, or user engagement in online platforms ([Hamari et al., 2014](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0035)). Critics of these approaches, however, argue that gamification applications are not about game design but instead center behavior modification techniques—with some going so far as to label these approaches as “exploitationware” ([Bogost, 2011](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0019)). [Audrey Watters (2014)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0071), a historian of educational technology, drew a distinction between game-based learning and gamification, citing similar differences between purposeful game design and approaches rooted in previously established approaches to behaviorism in education.

Developing what [Salen Tekinbaş and Zimmerman (2003)](https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438#acrefore-9780190264093-e-1438-bibItem-0054) referred to as a “critical discourse” on DGBL will be an essential part of moving the field forward, as well as addressing some of the empirically supported and philosophically grounded critiques and challenges facing the field. Perhaps just as important is an understanding of some of the historical and ideological roots of the field, to which this article now turns.

## What is game based learning?

The design of more engaging curriculum we need to include techniques that teaches students how to be **critical**, **confident** and **creative** as well as abilities that they will need for success in the **work-a-day future life**. Many schools have adopted game-based learning, a pedagogical approach that involves **designing learning activities through video games where the game characteristics and game principles inhere within the learning activities themselves**.

**Gaming is inherently motivating**, which may allow learners to gain skills and knowledge, by leveraging entertainment and weaving it within learning environments. Research studies indicate that video games in particular have great engagement and education related benefits.

## Engagement

Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak. When students aren’t engaged, they’re more likely to disrupt class, less likely to accept challenges, have lower grades, and aren’t confident in their ability to learn.

Additionally, **sustaining engagement** is very important to ensure that the student is gaining the most out of their learning experience and that their **cognitive skills are always stimulated**. Engaging through educational video games that are built on educational content has proven to be a great way not only to keep students engaged but also to **deliver complex theories/topics in an interactive manner** allowing students to have a **deeper comprehension of the content**.

# Motivation
Motivation is the force behind human performance. It can arise from physiological or psychological needs, thoughts, or emotions. Our physiological needs help us preserve optimal physical functioning, while psychological needs typically help us thrive.

The source of motivation can come from within ourselves or be external to us.

## Intrinsic Motivation

> **Intrinsic motivation** is when you are motivated by personal satisfaction or enjoyment instead of external factors like reward or punishment. There are ways to make tasks more intrinsically motivating.

Intrinsic motivation is the act of doing something without any obvious external rewards. You do it because it’s enjoyable and interesting, rather than because of an outside incentive or pressure to do it, such as a reward or deadline.

An example of intrinsic motivation would be reading a book because you enjoy reading and have an interest in the story or subject, rather than reading because you have to write a report on it to pass a class.

### Intrinsic motivation theory

There have been a number of different proposed theories to explain intrinsic motivation and how it works. Some experts believe that all behavior is driven by external reward, such as money, status, or food. In intrinsically motivated behaviors, the reward is the activity itself.

The most recognized theory of intrinsic motivation was first based on people’s needs and drives. Hunger, thirst, and sex are biological needs that we’re driven to pursue in order to live and be healthy.

Just like these biological needs, people also have psychological needs that must be satisfied in order to develop and thrive. These include the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

Along with satisfying these underlying psychological needs, intrinsic motivation also involves seeking out and engaging in activities that we find challenging, interesting, and internally rewarding without the prospect of any external reward.

### Intrinsic motivation vs. extrinsic motivation

**Intrinsic motivation comes from within, while extrinsic motivation arises from outside**. When you’re intrinsically motivated, you engage in an activity solely because you enjoy it and get personal satisfaction from it.

When you’re extrinsically motivated, you do something in order to gain an external reward. This can mean getting something in return, such as money, or avoiding getting into trouble, such as losing your job.

|   | Motivation | Goals |
|---|---|---|
|Intrinsic|You do the activity because it’s internally rewarding. You may do it because it’s fun, enjoyable, and satisfying.|Goals come from within and the outcomes satisfy your basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.|
|Extrinsic|You do the activity in order to get an external reward in return.	Goals are focused on an outcome and don’t satisfy your basic psychological needs.|Goals involve external gains, such as money, fame, power, or avoiding consequences.|

### Intrinsic motivation examples

You’ve likely experienced examples of intrinsic motivation throughout your entire life without giving it much thought.

Some examples of intrinsic motivation are:

- participating in a sport because it’s fun and you enjoy it rather than doing it to win an award
- learning a new language because you like experiencing new things, not because your job requires it
- spending time with someone because you enjoy their company and not because they can further your social standing
- cleaning because you enjoy a tidy space rather than doing it to avoid making your spouse angry
- playing cards because you enjoy the challenge instead of playing to win money
- exercising because you enjoy physically challenging your body instead of doing it to lose weight or fit into an outfit
- volunteering because you feel content and fulfilled rather than needing it to meet a school or work requirement
- going for a run because you find it relaxing or are trying to beat a personal record, not to win a competition
- taking on more responsibility at work because you enjoy being challenged and feeling accomplished, rather than to get a raise or promotion
- painting a picture because you feel calm and happy when you paint rather than selling your art to make money

### Intrinsic motivation factors

Everyone’s different and that includes what motivates us and our perspectives of rewards. Some people are more intrinsically motivated by a task while another person sees the same activity extrinsically.

Both can be effective, but research suggests that extrinsic rewards should be used sparingly because of the overjustification effect. Extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation when used in certain situations or used too often. The rewards may lose their value when you reward behavior that was already intrinsically motivating. Some people also perceive extrinsic reinforcement as coercion or bribery.

The overjustification effect has inspired an entire field of study that focuses on students and how to help them reach their full potential. Though experts are divided on whether extrinsic rewards have a beneficial or negative effect on intrinsic motivation, a recent study showed that rewards may actually encourage intrinsic motivation when given early in a task.

Researchers examined how reward timing influenced intrinsic motivation. They found that giving an immediate bonus for working on a task, rather than waiting until the task was completed, increased interest and enjoyment in it. Getting an earlier bonus increased motivation and persistence in the activity that continued even after the award was removed.

Understanding the factors that promote intrinsic motivation can help you see how it works and why it can be beneficial. These factors include:

- **Curiosity**. Curiosity pushes us to explore and learn for the sole pleasure of learning and mastering.
- **Challenge**. Being challenged helps us work at a continuously optimal level work toward meaningful goals.
- **Control**. This comes from our basic desire to control what happens and make decisions that affect the outcome.
- **Recognition**. We have an innate need to be appreciated and satisfaction when our efforts are recognized and appreciated by others.
- **Cooperation**. Cooperating with others satisfies our need for belonging. We also feel personal satisfaction when we help others and work together to achieve a shared goal.
- **Competition**. Competition poses a challenge and increases the importance we place on doing well.
- **Fantasy**. Fantasy involves using mental or virtual images to stimulate your behavior. An example is a virtual game that requires you to answer a question or solve a problem to move to the next level. Some motivation apps use a similar approach.
