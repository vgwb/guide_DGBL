# IEEDO App

## Introduction

The IEEDO App has been designed to support the coaches working with adult refugees in helping them in building resilience through digital self-learning.

**About the refugees:**

- Adult refugees with a basic knowledge of the local language and whose mother language is supported by the game (Arabic, French, Somali, Dari, Pashto, Tigrinya, Ukrainian) who owns a mobile phone (iOS or Android) and that are available to follow the program during a 1 or 2 months period
- Ideally the refugees should be in the middle of their integration process in the host country (i.e. ACH follow up process lasts 9 months divided in 3 trimesters, and we recommend to test the game during the second trimester)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- the coach should meet regularly with each refugee, ideally every 1 or 2 weeks
- the IEEDO program has been designed for a 1-to-1 coach-refugee relationship, but each partner can adapt it to its need (i.e. having group sessions)
- we provide a video tutorial (in English) about how to use the app as part of the coach training (see here below)
