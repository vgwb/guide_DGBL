# Introduction

> "Real, good, serious stuff can happen even inside of a playful ecosystem."

It is a truth universally acknowledged that teachers should make available activities that are capable of **involving students in the learning process**. Games and digital tools are terrains that amplify reality and that educators must explore to move in that direction. 

**Games and technology** represent perfect environments to facilitate exploration, having a strong impact on a student’s ability to learn-by-doing and **immediate acquisition** of knowledge and skills. 

While **playing and interacting** with different forms of reality, students can sometimes learn without even realizing it! Fun and engagement are the backgrounds on which abilities and understanding are constructed. Theory and practice are smoothly integrated into the process of **solving issues** within the scope of a game.
