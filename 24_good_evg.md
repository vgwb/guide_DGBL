## 2.4 What makes a good educational video game good?

How good video game designers create games that manage to get new players to learn long, complex and difficult games?
They build these games based on the good principles of learning that involve 3 main criteria, **Empowered Learners**, **Problem Solving** and **Understanding**. 

1. **Empowered Learners:** learners feel like active agents (producers) and not just passive recipients (consumers). It includes learning principles such as identity, customization, Manipulation and Distributed Knowledge.

2. **Problem-Solving:** good learning occurs through though-provoking challenges and problem that push the players creativity and forces them to use their building knowledge to solve problems. It includes principles such as Well-ordered problems, pleasantly frustrating principles, cycles of expertise, and just in Time and On-demand principles.

3. **Understanding:** good learning is based on acquired systematic thinking and comprehension, which allows the learner to comprehend and understand every element of their content/problem. It includes system Thinking principle and meaning as action image principle.

Good video games employ strategies that causes players to **exercise their learning muscles**, without knowing it and without having to pay overt attention to the matter.

Good educational video games excite human learning through **mind-provoking challenges** and hooks. Cognitive scientists identify good educational video games as games that are both fun as well as provide a good educational experience by **connecting to the student’s deeper appreciation for learning** and their own trajectory in life.

The three large criteria of a good educational game design if implemented in schools would necessitate significant changes in the structure and nature of formal schooling. Empowered Learners, Problem Solving and Understanding all entail important learning principles and features that the more they are present in the selected game, the stronger the game in delivering its content.

_**So what are the learning principles that a good educational video game is built on?**_

> The first attribute of a good educational video game is **how engaging it is**? 

Engagement is a broad category that involves many properties in order to sustain it.
Here is an outline of the learning principles of a good video educational video game.

## 2.5 Learning Principles
Here are the 16 principles of good video-game based learning:

1. **Identity**: Players build a sense of identity throughout the video game, either through direct input or an on-screen character they inherit.
2. **Interaction**: Communication occurs between the player and the game.
3. **Production**: Gamers help produce the story through some form of interaction, such as choosing a path, solving a puzzle or completing a level.
4. **Risk Taking**: Failing in a game holds few consequences in comparison to real life, empowering players to take risks.
5. **Customized**: Games usually offer a level of customization so that users can play - and succeed - at their competency level.
6. **Agency**: Players have control over the gaming environment.
7. **Well-Ordered Problems**: The gaming environment contains problems that naturally lead into one another, allowing a player’s mastery to grow and evolve.
8. **Challenge and Consideration**: Games offer a problem that challenges students’ assumed expertise.
9. **Just in Time or On Demand**: Players receive information as they need it, not before, which teaches them patience and perseverance and improves critical-thinking abilities.
10. **Situated Meanings**: Students learn new vocabulary words by experiencing them within game situations.
11. **Pleasantly Frustrating**: The game should frustrate the student enough to challenge them but be easy enough that they believe and can overcome the problem(s) faced.
12. **System Thinking**: Games make players think in a bigger picture, not just individual actions taken, helping them see how the pieces fit or can be fitted together.
13. **Explore, Think Laterally, Rethink Goals**: Games force players to expand their situational knowledge and consider courses of action other than linear ones.
14. **Smart Tools and Distributed Knowledge**: In-game tools help students understand the world. Through using them, they gain confidence to share their knowledge with others.
15. **Cross-Functional Teams**: In multiplayer environments, players have different skills, forcing them to rely on each other - a needed soft skill for students.
16. **Performance before Competence**: Competency occurs through taking action in the game, reversing the typical model in which students are required to learn before being allowed to act.

These learning principles should be applied to school learning at all times, not just through educational video games. They change the current trend for skill-and-drill, scripted instruction, and standardized multiple-choice testing.
