## Video Games and new teaching methods

Recent studies have shown that introducing educational video games (EVG) and adopting a game-based learning teaching approach, has helped students achieve better learning performance, improved student **engagement**, promote **motivation** and **active processing** of educational content.

Introducing video games into the classroom **enhances many learning and teaching skills** that can help elevate the educational experience of the classroom. This teaching method uses beneficial aspects of video games to transmit knowledge to students. It is based on **three key factors**:

1. It breathes life into education: it transforms learning into an **enjoyable**, thrilling game without boring lessons. Students assimilate and retain information almost without noticing.
2. It **boosts motivation**: students are the main characters in the story and their success is rewarded with medals, extra lives, bonuses, etc. This captures and keeps their interest in learning.
3. It gives **opportunities to practice** students can apply the knowledge they acquire without getting into dangerous situations. This is what flight and navigation simulators, for instance, are all about.
