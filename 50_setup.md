# 5. Teacher guide: setup

> **Learning Objectives:**
> In this Unit we see how a teacher can setup a learning session with students, the minimal procedure and sills required and the final assessment and evaluation

## A Digital Game Based Learning session
We can summarize a DGBL session in these five steps:

### 1. Introduction to videogame
The teacher explains the game and helps installing it on the students devices.
Then tells the outcomes expected from playing this game.

### 2. gameplay / experience
autonomous activity: the student becomes player

### 3. game results / scores
autonomous activity: the player finish to play. check the score

### 4. reflection / analysis
student and the teacher analyse together the outcome

### 5. forming abstract concepts + real world application

> exercise: order the 5 steps

# Teacher Skills
The teacher has to develop or at least know something about these topics:

- ICT / Basic Digital Skills
- Minimal game playing experience
- Deep understanding of how a game can help learning and its differences with a  classic book/course
- Recognise different players skills and support their game play
- Engage students in playing and progression

# Challenges
There could be some difficulties and challenges to be solved in order to achieve better results in DGBL sessions.

**Curriculum**: identify how a certain game can connect to the curriculum. 

**Game related**: identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the content of the game. Irrelevant or distracting content from the game that could not be removed.

**Attitudes**: persuading all stakeholders and non-players about the educational value of the game.

**Educators and Teachers support**: make them aware of how to use games more effectively in education.

**Assessment**: Traditional assessments do not often align with GBL, so new models and approaches must be considered.

**Developers** encourage and support game developers in the creation of better educational games

## 5.2 Students pre-evaluation and setupÂ 

### Hardware and Digital Skills evaluation
We want to know how much the user knows about digital world, hardware, smartphone

ðŸ“„ [Survey Digital Skills](1000_quiz_digital.md)

### VG Evaluation
We want to know if user knows a bit about videogames
ðŸ“„ [Survey Videogames](1000_quiz_videogames.md)

### Setup device
Install the game on the device and run it once.
If needed do some Android tuning (notifications, for example)
