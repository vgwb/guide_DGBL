# Teacher guide: setup

> **Learning Objectives:**
> In this Unit we see how a teacher can setup a learning session with students, the minimal procedure and sills required and the final assessment and evaluation

## A Digital Game Based Learning session
We can summarize a DGBL session in these five steps:

### 1. Introduction to videogame
The teacher explains the game and helps installing it on the students devices.
Then tells the outcomes expected from playing this game.

### 2. gameplay / experience
autonomous activity: the student becomes player

### 3. game results / scores
autonomous activity: the player finish to play. check the score

### 4. reflection / analysis
student and the teacher analyse together the outcome

### 5. forming abstract concepts + real world application

> exercise: order the 5 steps

# Teacher Skills
The teacher has to develop or at least know something about these topics:

- ICT / Basic Digital Skills
- Minimal game playing experience
- Deep understanding of how a game can help learning and its differences with a  classic book/course
- Recognise different players skills and support their game play
- Engage students in playing and progression

# Challenges
There could be some difficulties and challenges to be solved in order to achieve better results in DGBL sessions.

**Curriculum**: identify how a certain game can connect to the curriculum. 

**Game related**: identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the content of the game. Irrelevant or distracting content from the game that could not be removed.

**Attitudes**: persuading all stakeholders and non-players about the educational value of the game.

**Educators and Teachers support**: make them aware of how to use games more effectively in education.

**Assessment**: Traditional assessments do not often align with GBL, so new models and approaches must be considered.

**Developers** encourage and support game developers in the creation of better educational games



## 5.2 Students pre-evaluation and setupÂ 

### Hardware and Digital Skills evaluation
We want to know how much the user knows about digital world, hardware, smartphone

ðŸ“„ [Survey Digital Skills](1000_quiz_digital.md)

### VG Evaluation
We want to know if user knows a bit about videogames
ðŸ“„ [Survey Videogames](1000_quiz_videogames.md)

### Setup device
Install the game on the device and run it once.
If needed do some Android tuning (notifications, for example)

## 5.4 Evaluation tools

### Engagement Survey:
This questionnaire can be used after an activity has been completed to evaluate the level of engagement relative to another activity. In order to analyse the results and compare levels of engagement between two different activities the following steps should be taken.

- Allocate a value to each answer, where strongly disagree = -2 to strongly agree = 2
- For negative items (e.g. â€˜I could not tell what effect my actions hadâ€™) reverse this scale.
- Add up the total points to get a value for engagement with the activity.

Thinking about the activity you have just undertaken, please indicate the level to which you agree with the following statements:

> Strongly Disagree (-2) | Disagree (-1) | Neither agree nor disagree (0) | Agree (1) | Strongly Agree (2)

- I wanted to complete the activity
- I found the activity frustrating
- I felt that I could achieve the goal of the activity
- I knew what I had to do to complete the activity
- I found the activity boring
- It wasnâ€™t clear what I could and couldnâ€™t do
- It was clear what I could learn from the activity
- I felt absorbed in the activity 
- The activity was pointless
- I was not interested in exploring the options available
- I did not care how the activity ended
- I felt that time passed quickly
- I found the activity satisfying
- The activity would not let me do what I wanted
- I could not tell what effect my actions had
- I did not enjoy the activity
- Feedback I was given was useful
- I found it easy to get started
