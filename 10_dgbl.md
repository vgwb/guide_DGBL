- the power of Engagement
- How Game Based Learning works
- What skills does DGBL develop?

## 1.1 Definition

Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets.
There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving. Studies have investigated digital game-based learning in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that digital game-based learning has gradually become a trend and that digital game-based learning could improve students’ learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.

> **Digital** game based learning (**DGBL**) refers to using actual digital video games as learning tools.

## 1.2 Engagement

Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak. When students aren’t engaged, they’re more likely to disrupt class, less likely to accept challenges, have lower grades, and aren’t confident in their ability to learn.

Additionally, sustaining engagement is very important to ensure that the student is gaining the most out of their learning experience and that their **cognitive skills are always stimulated**. Engaging through educational video games that are built on educational content has proven to be a great way not only to keep students engaged but also to deliver complex theories/topics in an interactive manner allowing students to have a **deeper comprehension of the content**.

> Game-based learning and video games provide much more learning opportunities than expected.

## 1.3 What is game based learning?

Designing more engaging curriculum we need to include techniques that teaches students how to be **critical**, **confident** and **creative** as well as abilities that they will need for success in the **work-a-day future life**. Many schools have adopted game-based learning, a pedagogical approach that involves **designing learning activities through video games where the game characteristics and game principles inhere within the learning activities themselves**.

For example, in an Economics course, students might compete in a virtual stock-trading competition, in a science class, students learn about genetics through *Geniventure*, a dragon hereditary game. There are many forms of game-based learning, including introduction of badges, leaderboards, and educational video games. Our focus here is educational video games and how they can be utilized to enhance curriculum development and student content comprehension.

**Gaming is inherently motivating**, which may allow learners to gain skills and knowledge, by leveraging entertainment and weaving it within learning environments. Research studies indicate that video games in particular have great engagement and education related benefits.

## 1.4 Video Games and new teaching method

Recent studies have shown that introducing educational video games and adopting a game-based learning teaching approach, has helped students achieve better learning performance, improved student **engagement**, promote **motivation** and **active processing** of educational content.

Introducing video games into the classroom **enhances many learning and teaching skills** that can help elevate the educational experience of the classroom. This teaching method uses beneficial aspects of video games to transmit knowledge to students. It is based on **three key factors**:

1. It **breathes life into education**: it transforms learning into an enjoyable, thrilling game without boring lessons. Students assimilate and retain information almost without noticing.
2. It **boosts motivation**: students are the main characters in the story and their success is rewarded with medals, extra lives, bonuses, etc. This capture and keeps their interest in learning.
3. It gives **opportunities to practice** students can apply the knowledge they acquire without getting into dangerous situations. This is what flight and navigation simulators, for instance, are all about.

## 1.5 How effective are video games in the classroom?
PROS:
- Games teach students
- Tech Literacy
- Muti-tasking mentality develops
- Teamwork
- Long-ange planning
- Individualised instruction

CONS
- Cost (higher than book-paper-pencil paradigm)
- Distraction from other objectives
- Social isolation
- Shortened attention span

## 1.6 Skills developed

Additionally, playing video games has a huge impact on the development of **cognitive**, **collaboration**, **creative problem solving**, and **communication skills** of students. 
As well as improving learning abilities, there are other benefits. Here are some of them:

- Games **speed up response times**: improve troubleshooting skills by posing problems that must be solved in a set time.
- Games **encourage teamwork**: multiplayer games boost teamwork in problem-solving.
- Games **stimulate creativity, focus, and visual memory**: stimulate these aspects by setting goals that require concentration, imagination, and remembering details to achieve them.
- Games **improve strategy and leadership**: put players in command, honing their abilities to resolve disputes, interact with other players and make decisions.
- Games **teach languages**: they are useful for learning other languages through on-screen instructions, chats for communicating with other players, or the narration of the story itself.
- Games improve **Critical thinking**: with underlying ethical, philosophical and social basis, and their ability to make players think.

## 1.7 Games values
Games bring together combination of motivating elements not found together in any other medium. Indeed games: 
- are a form of fun -> _enjoyment and pleasure_
- are a form of play -> intense and passionate _involvement_
- are rules -> _structure_
- are goals -> _motivation_
- are interactive -> _doing_
- are adaptive -> _flow_
- have outcomes and feedback -> _learning_
- have a win state -> ego _gratification_
- have conflict/competition/challenge/opposition -> _adrenaline_
- have problem solving -> sparks _creativity_
- have peer interaction -> _social groups_
- have characters and story -> _emotions_
