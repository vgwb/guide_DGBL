**Learning Objectives:**
- when to implement educational video games?
- why implementing educational video games is important?

Let's see this video where James Paul Gee shares insights into why video games are such effective learning tools:

After learning about the benefits of educational video games and the characteristics of a good educational video game, we arrive at the question: how do we incorporate game-based learning for maximum benefit as well as when and where in the curriculum? Also, what about class management, how do we manage the environment of the class and students while playing the game?

In this unit, we will answer all these questions and provide a guideline and tips that instructors can follow when deciding to select and implement an educational video game.

## Learning Flow
Educational Games a special "flow", which is

### Tips for using VG in the classroom
1. Teachers do not need to be avid gamers, but they should at least be interested in them.
2.  Videogames should not be the main method for educating students. They are just **one of the tools available**.
3.  **Check the age recommendations** on videogames. Avoid those for 18 ears and over.
4. Before you select a videogame, be clear about the **skills and competencies** you want to develop.
5. Students are **motivated by progressing** from level to level. It Is Important not to set impossible challenges.
6. Schools must be equipped with **suitable technology** before Introducing videogames into the classroom.
7. Students can get hooked on videogames so teaching how to **control their use** is also part of classroom education.

## Incorporation of Educational Video Games (EVG)

_How to implement EVGs?_

There are many strategies and ways for educators to incorporate game-based learning and EVGs into their curriculum and classroom. Here are three ways that teachers can follow to implement game-based learning:

### Games as shared Experience
Where the EVGs selected plays more on experience, giving students the feel of being on a field trip. **Like a field trip**, students are first given instructions on what to expect and are then given freedom to explore an out-of-school location. And then back in the classroom, **instructors facilitate and emphasize the connections of the game to the curriculum**. These games, provide meaning for students.
For example in MineCraft students build structures and “When night comes and creepers attack, only the students who stayed in fortified structures survive. After play, we discuss the difficulties of setting up a colony in a hostile environment. Students understand the dangers of settling new worlds because they have experienced them”.

### Games as Text
These games allow users to decide the fate of the game. The game is built on a template uses player choice to tell a story. These include Examples include [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/), an open-world game about being a park ranger; [Life Is Strange](https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-gb/), an emotional tale of friendships and bullying at a private school; [Her Story](https://www.herstorygame.com/), a nonlinear, police procedural whodunit; and [1979 Revolution: Black Friday](https://www.gamesforchange.org/games/1979-revolution-black-friday/), a political thriller set in the Iranian Revolution.
Each game tells a *story*.
**Assessing learning** with these games, educators can use Office 365 or Google Docs. For example, English literature teacher Paul Darvasi has his students play the point-and-click exploration game [Gone Home](https://gonehome.com/), which is about a dysfunctional family. Set in 1995, the game uses literary devices like mood, tone, and theme. He has students take screenshots as evidence and add them to a shared document. Collected screenshots later lead to projects like comparing reviews and then writing their own.

### Games as Models
These games are built on model real-world systems. They give students the opportunity to create their own models within the game. A teacher states that he makes students play [Werewolf](https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules), and discuss “different actions that mirror the events of the Salem witch trials, McCarthyism, and other witch hunts. I also have students play the board game [Pandemic](https://www.zmangames.com/en/games/pandemic/), as well as the mobile game [Plague, Inc](https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc). These games illustrate how diseases travel the interconnected networks of the world. Students learn how the bubonic plague traveled along the Silk Road.”. He states that these games model causes that have effects, which subsequently have effects that teaches the **21st-century skill of systems thinking**.

### Other tools
Teachers also can create their own form of EVGs by creating learning games in Google Classroom: https://youtu.be/5TOXvl3Vig4

### When and why implement EVGs?
You must remember that game-based learning and EVGs are tools that should supplement/facilitate your pedagogy, they are not the teacher. When using these techniques in your classroom, **do not grade play**, **instead assess the learning transfer** that has been facilitated from the game experience to the curriculum.
Therefore, choosing to implement EVGs should come as a reason to enhance content delivery and comprehension as well as motivate students to understand complex theories/content in a mind engaging and challenging manner.

### 16 reasons as to why to implement EVGs in the classroom

1. Promote technology exploration
2. Develop problem-solving skills
3. Develop educational mastery and complete tasks in a logical manner
4. Develop reasoning and complexity thinking
5. Develop fine motor skills
6. Build interest in STEAM fields
7. Teach Students basic programming
8. Develop confidence and social skills
9. Learn Collaboration skills
10. Emphasize also individualized learning
11. Provide a **safe environment** to explore and in which to **make mistakes**
12. Learn through enjoyment and "fun"
13. Contextualised, goal oriented instead of abstract learning
14. Experiential learning: learning by doing
15. Intrinsic motivation: playing is voluntary and self-driven
16. Seamless accountability and feedback

### Games values
Games bring together combination of motivating elements not found together in any other medium. Indeed games: 
- are a form of fun -> _enjoyment and pleasure_
- are a form of play -> intense and passionate _involvement_
- are rules -> _structure_
- are goals -> _motivation_
- are interactive -> _doing_
- are adaptive -> _flow_
- have outcomes and feedback -> _learning_
- have a win state -> ego _gratification_
- have conflict/competition/challenge/opposition -> _adrenaline_
- have problem solving -> sparks _creativity_
- have peer interaction -> _social groups_
- have characters and story -> _emotions_

## The Flow state
The Flow state in an experience as the equilibrium point between challenge and ability. If the challenge is quite higher than the ability the result will be the person getting frustrated and with the feeling of anxiety, on the other hand if the person’s skill is higher than the challenge presented he will experience boredom.
Games should be designed and calibrated the ensure that the player maximises its staying within the *flow channel*

## Unit review
Discuss, in your opinion the importance of implementing game-based learning.
Could there be complications to this process? if so, what would they be?
