## 4.1 Where to find EVG
When choosing an EVG we have several options where to look.
We could:

- Use entertainment/**commercial games**. These games are already in the stores and could have additional or not explicit educational content (Assassin's Creed / Civilization)
- **Modify** entertainment games. Many commercial games allow to create custom missions or quests (Kerbal Space Academy)
- Use **virtual worlds**. There are many "sandbox" games where the player sparks creativity and teacher could pre-build the learning environment (Minecraft)
- Use **educational games** created ad hoc (MinecraftEdu)
- **Create original games**. If a special requirements is needed, you could develop or ask to develop a custom game (Antura)
- **Let students create games**, to design a game you have to study and manage the learning content very deeply
