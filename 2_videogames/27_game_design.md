## Gamification

Game-based learning should not be confused with gamification.

**DGBL** offers a delicate balance between in-class lessons and educational gameplay. Teachers introduce students to new concepts and show them how they work. Then students practise these concepts through digital games.

**Gamification** involves taking elements from games -- such as game mechanics, leaderboards, levels, or points --  and applying them to non-game contexts to engage users better. The purpose of this is to make lessons that might not be enjoyable more engaging for students.

Some examples of game mechanics used in gamification are:
- **Goals** - Complete the task and get a reward, such as a **badge** or points.
- **Status** - Users increase their level or rank through completing activities. **Leaderboards** show who is ‘winning’ and inspire users to work harder to compete.
- **Community** - Users are paired or put in groups to solve problems, complete activities, or otherwise achieve an objective.
- **Education** - Tips, tricks and quizzes are given to the user throughout the process.
- **Rewards** - As mentioned above, points and badges are common, and useful, rewards. Other rewards could be discounts, coupons, or gift cards. This fuels the user’s motivation and keeps engagement high.

Gamification takes an element of education and replaces it with a game-based element. For instance, a teacher may replace grades with levels or experience points.

## The Flow state
The Flow state in an experience as the equilibrium point between challenge and ability. If the challenge is quite higher than the ability the result will be the person getting frustrated and with the feeling of anxiety, on the other hand if the person’s skill is higher than the challenge presented he will experience boredom.
Games should be designed and calibrated the ensure that the player maximises its staying within the *flow channel*
