## 2.6 Gamification
Game-based learning should not be confused with gamification.

Gamification is the process of using game mechanics, elements, and principles and applying them to non-game contexts to engage users better.

Some examples of game mechanics used in gamification are:
- **Goals** - Complete the task and get a reward, such as a **badge** or points**.**
- **Status** - Users increase their level or rank through completing activities. **Leaderboards** show who is ‘winning’ and inspire users to work harder to compete.
- **Community** - Users are paired or put in groups to solve problems, complete activities, or otherwise achieve an objective.
- **Education** - Tips, tricks and quizzes are given to the user throughout the process.
- **Rewards** - As mentioned above, points and badges are common, and useful, rewards. Other rewards could be discounts, coupons, or gift cards. This fuels the user’s motivation and keeps engagement high.

Gamification takes an element of education and replaces it with a game-based element. For instance, a teacher may replace grades with levels or experience points.
